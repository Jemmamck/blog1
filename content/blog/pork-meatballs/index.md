Perfect for meal prepping, these 5 ingredient meatballs can be frozen for up to 3 months. Chuck them in a pasta, a sandwich, a salad, YOU NAME IT! These meatballs are more versatile than your favourite little black dress.

## Ingredients

* 500g minced pork
* ½ white onion, grated
* ½ cup Italian breadcrumbs
* ½ cup Parmesan cheese, grated
* 1 large egg

## Directions

1. Preheat the oven to 170°C and line a baking tray with baking paper.
2. In a large mixing bowl, combine all meatball ingredients. Mix to combine, but avoid over-mixing.
3. Once combined, portion into golf ball-sized meatballs and place onto lined baking sheet. (I like to use a cookie scoop for this step so that they’re all evenly sized)
4. Transfer to oven and bake for 8-10 minutes or until they begin to turn golden brown.
